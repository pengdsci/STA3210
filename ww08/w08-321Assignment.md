THis week's assignment focuses on the binary predictive modeling using the logistic regression model. I used the same data set that used in previous few weeks to build a logistic predictive model for predicting the occurrence of the diabetes.

You are expected to use the same data set you used in the three of your assignment to build a predictive logistic regression model.

Please read the note carefully and reproduce my my analysis to make sure you understand the concepts and my analysis logic in the analysis.

Your write-up your assignment should be **same as** my case-study (section 3 of my class note for this week). To be more specific, you are expected to use my case-study as a template to complete this assignment. The following are the major components I expected you to include in your report.

* Introduction - description what you plan to do in the analysis
* Description of data and variables
  + information of data collection process.
  + list of variable names and **definitions**.
* Research question(s) - what is the objective of the analysis
* Variable transformation and discretization
  + list the numerical variables you standardize 
  + list of variable you discretize
* Data split - the proportions of data for training and testing sets
* Candidate models - you can the candidate model you used in the previous assignment on multiple logistic regression model.
* The final model selection
  + Cross-validation method
  + ROC approach (**This is optional**)
