This assignment focuses on the conceptual understanding of decomposing time series and forecasting with decomposing. as mentioned in the closing paragraph of the case study in the class note, the goal of this assignment are (1) enhance your aconceptual understanding of methods of decomposition and forecasting; (2) find asspropriate training size to produce the best performance.

The following web sites contain some time series data. You can find one time series that has at least 150 observations. If your data set has more 150, you choose 150-200 most recent observation to complete the assignment. The analysis and components in the analysis should be similar to that in the case-study in the class note.
